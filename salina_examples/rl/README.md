# RL Examples

We provide many reinforcement learning examples to show how to use the library.

* For a step-by-step tutorial, please have a look at the [A2C Examples](a2c/) that present different aspect of the library

* [A2C](a2c/)
* [REINFORCE](rl/reinforce/) shows a simple implementation of REINFORCE with `salina`
* [DDPG](ddpg/)
* [TD3](td3/)
* [PPO Discrete](ppo_discrete/)
* [PPO Continuous](ppo_continuous/)
* [Deep Q-Learning](dqn/)
* More to come...

## RL Benchmark

Algorithms have been benchmarked on classical environments (including Atari and MUJOCO).

* See [RL Benchmark](BENCHMARK.md)

## RL Projects

SaLinA has already been used in more complex RL projects :

* Learning a subpsace of policies for online adaptation in Reinforcement Learning ([code](rl/LoP/) | [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05169.pdf))


* See [RL Benchmark](BENCHMARK.md)
